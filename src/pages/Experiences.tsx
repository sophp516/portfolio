                        I was selected as one of four students to participate in the Dartmouth Computer Science Department's WISP (Women in STEM Project) internship under the mentorship of Professor Lorie Loeb. As a Full Stack Developer during this internship, I collaborated with three fellow interns to develop a web platform aimed at streamlining course planning and sharing for Dartmouth students. Our team presented the finished prototype at the Karen E. Wetterhahn Science Symposium.

                        As a Full-Stack Developer at the Digital Applied Learning and Innovation Lab (DALI) at Dartmouth College since August 2023, I have collaborated with multidisciplinary teams to design and build a variety of digital solutions, including mobile apps, websites, and VR/AR experiences for lab partners and clients. I develop full-stack applications in fast-paced, 10-week sprints using diverse technologies and frameworks. Currently, I am working on the Smart Microscope project, where I am integrating a machine learning algorithm hosted on a cloud service into a user-friendly web application.

                        As a Mobile Application Developer Intern for the Summer Environmental Education Development Program at Dandilyonn from June to August 2024, I collaborated with a team to design and develop Dineable, a React Native app aimed at enhancing campus dining experiences by allowing students to review and share dining hall information. I implemented full-stack features using React Native, Expo, XCode, and Firestore, successfully delivering a functional app based on Figma mockups within a 10-week timeframe. Additionally, I participated in peer review sessions, providing and receiving constructive feedback across multiple teams to improve our collective work.
